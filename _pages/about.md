Hi! I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master's degree in Computer and Information Science (MSE/CIS). I'm currently seeking full-time entry-level Software Development Engineer roles. Before UPenn, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2019.

My professional experience focuses on full-stack development using `Node.js`, with `React` for the frontend and various `AWS` services for the backend. Beyond `TypeScript`, I also enjoy working with `C/C++` for performance-critical applications, such as large-scale distributed Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search systems used in vector databases.

I love working on projects for both coursework and personal enjoyment. Scroll down to see some of my highlighted projects!

In my free time, I am a PC gamer who enjoys the `Souls` series and an anime enthusiast. Feel free to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/plasmas).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
